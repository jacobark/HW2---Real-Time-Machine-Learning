# HW2---Real-Time-Machine-Learning
Exploring LeNet Nueral Net Model. Adjusting convolution window size, output channel size, number of convolution layers, number of fully connected layers, and learning rates to observe their efffect on the accuracy and complexity of the neural net model.
Also exploring the AlexNet Neural Net Model.
